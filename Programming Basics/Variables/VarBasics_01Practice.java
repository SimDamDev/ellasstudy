                For these ones don't worry about putting your code in a special software (or IDE  -- look it up! :) )
                yet. You can download these or copy and paste them into a text editor like notepad. Right now just test
                your skills! I will also list a good youtube video for downloading a Java IDE* as that is what my
                examples are in.
